# VibeCode1
First iteration for vibecoding in the study

What we are building:

A student organization needs a snack kiosk software system where the students can by some snacks and drinks. The software should be web-based to enable an admin to access the system remotely. In the software the products are shown and need to have a title, a picture and a price. From the touch screen the students should be able to select the product(s) they wish to purchase and then the paymen should be handled via MobilePay transaction system with a QR code. 

The admin should be able to access the system remotely and do the following actions: check the inventory, update the inventory, see some statistics about how the product are selling. The admin should be able to disable the inventory so that the web app acts just as a ‘pick your poducts and pay’. 

Needs for the build:

Docker integration so that all dependencies are already installed and build is simple.

Generally use best practices.

Stack:

React with typescript where possible, PostgreSQL, node, express
